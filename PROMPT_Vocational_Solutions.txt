## RESEARCH PROTOCOL

### PILLAR 1: ENROLLMENT VELOCITY ANALYSIS
**Objective:** Determine if the vocational education surge (11.7% in 2025) is accelerating, stabilizing, or reversing.

**Execute these searches:**
1. "National Student Clearinghouse vocational enrollment data 2025 2026"

4. "four-year university enrollment decline 2025 2026"

**What to extract:**
- Latest enrollment percentages (vocational vs. traditional college)
- Year-over-year growth rates
- Any geographic hotspots or regional variations
- Credible sources: National Student Clearinghouse, Department of Education, state education boards

**Output requirement:** Summarize the 3-5 most significant datapoints with sources and dates.

---

### PILLAR 2: CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT & POLICY ARCHITECTURE
**Objective:** Track where money and political capital are flowing to validate trend durability.

**Execute these searches:**
1. "skilled trades infrastructure funding 2025 2026"
2. "workforce development legislation passed 2025"
3. "Fortune 500 apprenticeship program launches 2025"

### PILLAR 3: JOB DESTRUCTION/CREATION ASYMMETRY
**Objective:** Create stark, data-backed contrasts between at-risk white-collar jobs and high-demand trades.

**Execute these searches:**
1. "AI job displacement forecast 2025 entry level positions"
2. "GPT-5 Claude impact on paralegal legal assistant jobs"
3. "Bureau of Labor Statistics skilled trades demand 2025 2026"
4. "automation resistant occupations 2025"
5. "paralegal job outlook vs electrician demand 2025"
6. "accounting clerk automation vs HVAC technician shortage"

**What to extract:**
- Specific job categories facing contraction (with percentages)
- AI capabilities now replacing these roles (cite specific tools/studies)
- Trades with highest unfilled demand (with numbers)
- Wage comparisons between at-risk office jobs and growing trades
- Training cost differentials

**Output requirement:** Find at least TWO compelling "death match" contrasts with full data:
- Job A (at-risk): % decline forecast, median debt to enter, automation risk
- Job B (ascending): % growth forecast, unfilled positions, training cost, starting wage

---

### PILLAR 4: ECONOMIC COERCION METRICS
**Objective:** Update the financial squeeze pushing people away from traditional college.

**Execute these searches:**
1. "student loan debt total 2025 Federal Reserve"

- Average 4-year degree cost vs. 2-year trade certification
- Tuition growth rates
- Time-to-positive-ROI comparisons

**Output requirement:** Document current cost differential and debt crisis status with sources.

## NARRATIVE GENERATION

After completing all research, generate THREE publication-ready narrative hooks:

### HOOK #1: THE SHOCKING STATISTIC
**Format:**
"[Specific recent datapoint from your research] suggests [clear implication]. This represents [historical context or comparison]. The shift appears to correlate with [recent AI capability or policy announcement]."

**Requirements:**
- Lead with the most surprising/timely number you found
- Include proper citation: "[Stat] per [Source], [Month Year]"
- Keep under 100 words
- Avoid absolutes ("will," "must," "always")

**Example structure:**
"Q4 2025 data from the National Student Clearinghouse indicates vocational enrollments surged 14.2% while four-year public universities declined 3.1%‚Äîthe largest divergence since the post-WWII GI Bill era. This acceleration appears to correlate with Anthropic's October 2025 analysis projecting 47% of entry-level knowledge work roles could be automated within 18 months."

---

### HOOK #2: THE CAREER DEATH MATCH
**Format:**
Create a side-by-side comparison of one at-risk white-collar job vs. one ascending trade job using your Pillar 3 research.

**Structure:**
**Role A: [At-Risk White-Collar Position]**
- Job outlook: [% decline] per [source]
- Automation threat: [specific AI capability replacing tasks]
- Median debt to enter field: $[amount]
- Entry-level salary: $[amount]

**Role B: [Ascending Skilled Trade]**
- Job outlook: [% growth] with [number] unfilled positions per [source]
- Automation risk: [why it's resistant]
- Training cost: $[amount]
- Entry-level salary: $[amount] ([percentage] higher than Role A)

**Conclusion:** "The credentialed 'knowledge worker' path faces algorithmic disruption while the 'dirty jobs' Mike Rowe championed are becoming premium careers."

**Requirements:**
- Use real data from your searches
- Cite all statistics
- Make the contrast visceral and specific
- Keep under 150 words total

---

### HOOK #3: THE IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL
**Format:**
"Based on current intelligence, here are three moves worth investigating this week:"

**1. HIGH-VELOCITY TRADE:**
[Specific certification/trade] showing [X]% growth in job postings with [number]-week training timeline and starting wages of $[amount] per [source]. [One-sentence context on why demand is surging].

**2. NEW FUNDING MECHANISM:**
[Specific program name] announced [date] by [organization] offering [benefit] for [qualifying individuals]. Application deadline: [date]. [One sentence on eligibility].

**3. COST ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY:**
[Specific observation from your Pillar 4 research about cost differential or ROI advantage]. [One sentence making it concrete and actionable].

**Requirements:**
- All three must come from your research findings
- Include specific numbers, dates, program names
- Make it actionable (give enough info that someone could Google and find it)
- Keep under 200 words total

- Skilled trades ‚Üí Surging demand (plumbers: 4% annual growth, 44,000 openings) + automation-resistant
- Vocational education ‚Üí 11.7% enrollment jump in 2025, nearly 20% growth since 2020

**Success metric:** CHIP gets recognized as the person who called this trend before mainstream coverage caught up.
